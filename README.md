# .emacs.taps
Git-able customizations for the Exordium emacs system.

When first setting up on a new machine, after pulling down Exordium from
https://github.com/philippe-grenet/exordium.git to establish your local copy of
.emacs.d, clone this repo to establish your customizations:

```bash
cd ~/.emacs/d
mkdir -p taps/$USER
cd taps/$USER
git clone <protocol>:$USER/.emacs.taps .
```
